#+title: My configuration files

This is the repository for my configuration files. For the moment I am recording Emacs, LaTeX, and the subscription list for Elfeed (in Org Mode).

* Emacs configuration

In my =~/.emacs.d/init.el= file I have the following line

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load "~/config/dotFiles/emacs_init/init.el")
#+end_src

This loads the named file, which states the initial configuration ~org-babel-load-file~ needs to load the =dot_emacs.org=, which contains the configuration by itself.

* List of blogs

I always find interesting to discover new blogs in other Blogrolls. This is not a Blogroll by itself, but the complete list, in case you want to dig deeper.

* LaTeX Styles

These are the established styles I use for my documents in LaTeX. Some other modifications are made in a per-document base, but these are the skeletons.
